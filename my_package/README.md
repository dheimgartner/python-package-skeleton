# Example Package

Clone this repo to get a basic package structure!

This is my first example package. After having setup the setup file, I now write these lines.
They will be leveraged in the `long_description` within the `setup()` call in `setup.py`.

This is just a simple markdown ...
You can use [Github-flavored Markdown] (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to write your content.

Install this package using `python -m pip install [-e] "git+https://github.com/dheimgartner/python-package-skeleton.git#egg=my-package-dheim&subdirectory=my_package"`. Recall, that `my-package-dheim` is the name used in `setup.py` and not your package repo (example_pkg)!
